##### Listen to the bass notes
One of the big tricks is learning what NOT to listen to. Songs may have drums, bass, piano, guitars, vocals, harmonies — so many things at once. Start with the **bass notes** (lowest notes), which are the foundation. Block out everything else, then add music theory. 
##### Learn about Chord Groups (Diatonic)
If you know what key you are in, and can figure out the bass note, the 90% of the time you’ll be able to know what chord is being played.
So what exactly is a diatonic chord? Each key signature has a group of chords that are naturally created by it. For example, 
**Diatonic chords in C major:** 
C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim.
Notice the combination (order): Major, minor, minor, Major, Major, minor, and diminished. No matter what major key you are on you will always get the same combination.
Example: Bass note = C → chord = C Major  
Bass note = E → chord = Em  
Works ~90% of the time.

##### Exercise 6.1:
- Memorize diatonic chords for major scales.  
- Remember the Major, minor, minor, Major, Major, minor, diminished pattern.

#### Scales
A series of eight notes that begins and ends on the same note. Each note is designated a number from 1 through 8.

##### Major Scale
A series of whole steps(Whole Tone) with half steps(Semi-Tone) located at the 3-4 and 7-8 intervals of the scale. 
The half step formula for a major scale is: 
**2 2 1 2 2 2 1**

##### Exercise 6.2:
- Play major scales from any starting note (white or black).  
- Do **not** use references; concentrate only on the numerical order.  
- Repeat until flawless; ear will signal mistakes.  
- This ingrains the numerical pattern in your mind.

##### Why Picking out a Major Scale is so Important
The above exercise removes all doubt that you are able to create a major scale starting anywhere on the keyboard from scratch. It is this numerical pattern that controls music and the reason why you must be able to do it flawlessly each time, every time.
Being able to do this is the basis for everything you count in music. It is the key to building chords, transposing and playing by ear.
##### Common Progressions
The other thing that is really helpful in charting songs is understanding common chords progressions. What this means is that there are certain combinations of chords that happen a lot together… and in a certain order. One thing that really helps with this is understanding Nashville Numbers. 
Once you start to recognize these patterns you’ll almost be able to predict many times what chord is going to come next. Eventually chord progressions start to become predictable in the same way. Next I’ll talk about Nashville Numbers so you can see how all keys are similar when you see them as numbers.

### Nashville Numbers (Number System)
What do these groups of chords have in common?
Key of C: C Am F G
Key of D: D Bm G A
Key of Eb: Eb Cm Ab Bb
Don't worry if you have no idea... 
The Answer: They are all this Nashville Number progression: 1, 6-, 4, 5
_Why I’ll explain._
Nashville Numbers assign numbers to chords based on their position in a key’s major scale. If you can train yourself to think in numbers then you will be able to pick songs out easier, chart faster, and be able to recognize chord progressions like a pro.
**Example:** Key of C → C Dm Em F G Am Bdim → 1 2- 3- 4 5 6- 7dim.
Common chord progression: C Am F G → 1 6- 4 5.
Using numbers makes it easy to transpose songs to any key while keeping the same progression.
**Example:**
If we had a song that the chords went C Em F G… then in numbers it would be 1 3- 4 5. Now let's say that the key of "C" is too low for the singer (diva... just kidding). 
C Em F G → 1 3- 4 5; moved to D → D F#m G A → 1 3- 4 5.
**Benefits:** simplifies charting, helps recognize patterns, and allows quick transposition across keys.
##### Exercise 6.3:
Create a chord chart with lyrics for *“See You Again”* (Wiz Khalifa & Charlie Puth).  
Identify the key and list **all diatonic chords**.
##### Exercise 6.4:
Create another chord chart for “See You Again” by Wiz Khalifa & Charlie Puth, but, this time use the Number System to represent the chords.

#### It’s All Numbers
- Viewing music numerically helps you track chords, build new ones, transpose keys, and chart progressions.
- Understanding one key numerically means you understand all keys—the symmetry of music.
- Practicing scales trains your hands to memorize finger patterns, making any key playable without constantly checking notation.
- Key signatures are just identifiers; scales reduce to 8-note patterns, so sharps and flats aren’t inherently harder.
- Focus on the numerical order of notes and whole/half steps—this builds complete control and play-by-ear ability.
- The major scale is the foundation of music theory; mastering it allows you to generate scales, chords, and progressions in any key.
