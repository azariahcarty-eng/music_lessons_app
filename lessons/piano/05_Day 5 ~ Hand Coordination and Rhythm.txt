##### Practicing Without the Keys
This is going to be (quite literally) a VERY hands-on lesson. I want you to stretch your hands open in front of you and then begin patting them onto something that is not your keyboard. Any flat surface, like a tabletop or the solid top of your piano, should work great.
Begin counting an even 1-2-3-4 over and over as you pat the surface with both hands. There should be one to two seconds per pat. Each pat is what we call a “beat.” Continue until your rhythm is comfortable and consistent.
Next, let’s alternate hands. Pat your left hand on the 1 and the 3 and your right hand on the 2 and the 4, keeping your beat consistent.
Once you’re comfortable with that, switch it up. Continue alternating your hands, but this time start with your right hand. So now your right hand will pat on the 1 and the 3 and your left hand will pat on the 2 and the 4.
Now we’re going to make it even more challenging. Pat your left hand on all four beats, but your right hand just on the 2 and the 4. Once you have that down, continue with your left hand, but pat your right hand on the 1 and the 3. And then finally, still doing the same thing with your left hand, pat your right hand on the 1, the 3, and the 4.
See how you’re starting to do something different with your right hand and your left?
Next, let’s repeat those last few patterns, but this time pat your right hand on all four beats and vary your left hand.
##### Applying It to the Keys
Finally, you’re going to repeat this whole sequence but on your keys! Find a C-major chord, using both your right and left hands, and repeat the same series of instructions, but instead of patting a surface, actually play the keys!

##### Exercise 5.1:
Using the backing track, play your left hand on every beat and your right hand on just the 2 and the 4. (See Ex3.4)
##### Exercise 5.2:
Use the backing track, but this time you choose the pattern. Select which beats you’ll play with your left hand and which beats you’ll play with your right hand.
##### Exercise 5.3:
Use the backing track, but this time play your left hand on the 1 and the 4 and your right hand on the 1 and the 3. This is a fun pattern, and I want you to get really comfortable with it.
##### Exercise 5.4:
Repeat the pattern from exercise 5.3, but this time without the backing track. Really focus on consistent timing and on not sneaking in any extra time while changing to a new chord.
