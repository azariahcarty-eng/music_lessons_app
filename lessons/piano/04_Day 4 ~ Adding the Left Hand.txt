##### The Role of Each Hand
So far you have only been playing with your right hand, so it’s time to bring in the left. But first, let’s look at what role each of your hands will play with my approach to piano.
I will never tell you to play chords with your left hand. That’s because chords or triads played on the left-most portion of your keyboard sound “muddy.” Bad. Just not good! Meanwhile, when played near the middle or on the right side of your keyboard, they sound great! So you are going to be keeping all your chords near the center and/or on the right, and you will always play them with your right hand.
Meanwhile, your left hand is going to bring in bass notes that will enhance what you play with your right hand. Most of the time, you will play two bass notes with your left hand, mirroring the root note of the main chord. So for example, if you are playing a C chord with your right hand, your left hand can play two C notes (this is not considered a chord).

##### Adding in the Left Hand
To add the left hand to what we’ve already learned, let’s practice with the C-major chord first. Play the C-major chord with your right hand, using our 4-3 formula. And now, at the same time, play two C keys with your left hand. The notes you are playing should look like this:

Now you can try this with other chords. Let’s look at the F-major chord. With your right hand, play the F-major chord; with your left hand, play two F keys.

Then, try it with a G-major chord.

There is no difference in how we handle the left hand with minor chords and other more advanced chord types. Eventually we’ll learn more advanced left-hand techniques, but for now, let’s focus on playing those two bass notes on the left to go along with each chord on the right.
While your left pinky and thumb are playing the two bass notes, leave your middle three left fingers alone for now: you can rest them gently on the keys or keep them slightly lifted, it’s up to you.
**If You’re Struggling...**
You may feel like there are too many things happening at once, or feel unsure of where to look now that both hands are playing at the same time. Please trust me when I say that what seems difficult right now will become second nature to you with a bit more practice.
If you are struggling with getting all your fingers in the right place or with looking at all of them at the same time, try to focus on getting the root notes down first and letting the other fingers follow. You can do this!

##### Exercise 4.1 – Call and Response  
- Play all 6 chords with left-hand bass added. 
##### Exercise 4.2 – Backing Track 1 
Play along with the backing track, which includes all six chords we have learned at this point, and add in the left hand. (See Ex3.3)
##### Exercise 4.3 – “4-Chord Song” 
Play along with the backing track (“The 4-Chord Song”) like you did on Day 3, but this time add in the left hand. Play each chord one time before playing the next chord. (See Ex3.4)
##### Exercise 4.4 – Twice per chord 
Play along with the backing track from exercise 4.3 again, but this time play each chord two times before moving on to the next chord. So, for example, when the backing track shows C, you should play the C-major chord twice before the track moves to G. Make sure the chords are all evenly spaced and that you keep the beat.

For Medium and Fast, (See Ex3.4)
##### Exercise 4.5 – Four times per chord  
Play along with the backing track from exercise 4.3 again, but this time play each chord four times before moving on to the next chord.
##### Exercise 4.6 – Practice without backing track 
Repeat the previous exercise, but this time do not use the backing track. Practice the “4-Chord Song” chord progression, playing each chord four times before moving on to the next chord. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: the timing between all the chords should be the same. For example, the time between playing a C-major chord and another C-major chord should be the same as the time between playing a C-major chord and a G-major chord. It is critical we get this timing down from the start. Play as slowly as you need to in order to get the correcting timing.
