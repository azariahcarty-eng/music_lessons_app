### The Number System
##### Scales Numbers
The tones of a scale can be numbered:  
**1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8** (or 1 at the octave)
##### Chord Numbers
Chords built on each tone in the scale are numbered using Roman numerals:  
**I - ii - iii - IV - V - vi - vii**
##### Chord Scale Tone Numbers
The basic chord tones are usually: **1-3-5-7-9-11-13** relative to the root tone of the scale.

##### Order of Flats (b) and Sharps (#)
- **Flats order:** B, E, A, D, G, C, F  
  *Mnemonic:* “Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles Father”
- **Sharps order:** F, C, G, D, A, E, B  
  *Mnemonic:* “Father Charles Goes Down And Eats Bread”  
- Note: Flats order is sharps order reversed.

### Chords
A combination of **three or more notes** played in unison forming harmony.

Four basic chord qualities are shown using C as an example i.e. major, minor, augmented and diminished. These chords are the foundation for building extended and altered chords in contemporary harmony.
**Chord Numbers:**  
- Major/Dominant: uppercase Roman numerals (I, IV, V)  
- Minor/Diminished: lowercase Roman numerals (ii, iii, vi, vii)  
- Use `#` or `b` to show raised or lowered notes.

### Roman Numeral Analysis
_In music theory you will come across Roman numeral analysis. In music, Roman numerals are used to represent chords, coordinating with scale degrees 1-7. For instance, “IV” denotes the chord built on the fourth degree of a scale._
- Uppercase = major chords  
- Lowercase = minor chords  
**Symbols for Remaining Chords:**

- Augmented: I+, III+  
- Diminished: vi°, vii°  
- Half-diminished: viiØ7, vii-7(b5)  
- Suspended: IVsus2, Vsus4  
- Major 6th: I6  
- Minor 6th: I-6  
- Major 7th: I△, IV△  
- Minor 7th: Im7, vi-7  
- Minor-Major 7th: ivm△, vi-△  
- Dominant 7th: IV7, V7  
- Extended chords: ii9, V#11, V13  
- Altered tones: add(#5, b9, #9, #11, b13)

### Inversions
- **Root Position (a):** Root is lowest note  
- **1st Inversion (b):** Third is lowest note  
- **2nd Inversion (c):** Fifth is lowest note  
- **3rd Inversion (d):** Seventh is lowest note (for 7th chords)

##### Relative Minor Keys
Each major key has a relative minor key, which contains exactly the same notes. To find the relative mine submediant (sixth) note of the major scale. For example, the relative minor of C major, is A minor.
