**Lesson on Inversions: 
_Using Moondance by Van Morrison as an example, I'II start by showing how the melody of the chorus can be played with inversions. 
We'll see how the four shapes of chord inversions share a common structure.
We'll look at how Am7 and Dm7 inversions are laid out on the fretboard and how to switch between those two chords._
