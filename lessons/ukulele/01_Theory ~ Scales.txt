### Ukulele Scales
A scale is simply a sequence of musical notes that rises in pitch. A scale can start on any of the twelve musical notes. The most popular scale is the Major Scale.
If we start a major scale on the note C, we call it the C major scale. When we play a C major scale, there are no sharps or flats. The notes are C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C.
