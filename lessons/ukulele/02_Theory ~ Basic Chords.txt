A **chord** is when you play **3 or more notes together**. On the ukulele, we have four strings, so it‚Äôs ideal to play chords. Strumming chords is a good way to accompany melody.

### Chord Families ‚Äì Harmonising The Major Scale
##### What‚Äôs a chord family?
Imagine chords are **friends who like to play together**. Some friends like each other a lot, so they play together often in songs. That group of friends is called a **chord family**.  
##### The ‚ÄúHome Chord‚Äù
Every chord family has a **home chord**. This is like the **main friend**. 
In the key of **C**, the home chord is **C major**.  
It feels comfy and complete. üè†
