## Ukulele Scales
A scale is simply a sequence of musical notes that rises in pitch. A scale can start on any of the twelve musical notes. The most popular scale is the Major Scale.

If we start a major scale on the note C, we call it the C major scale. When we play a C major scale, there are no sharps or flats. The notes are C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C.

## Chords
A chord is three or more notes that sound good together. On the ukulele, we have four strings, so it’s ideal to play chords. Strumming chords is a good way to accompany melody.

## Basic Chord Chart

## Keys and Transposition
Melodies come from scales, especially the major scale. A major scale can start on any note, giving us 12 keys.

## Chord Families – Harmonising The Major Scale
Chords come from scales. For example, the first, third, and fifth notes of the C Major Scale (C, E, G) give the C Major triad.

## Chords With Four Notes
We can add a fourth note to a triad chord, creating seventh chords like CM7, Dm7, Em7, FM7, G7, Am7, Bm7b5.

## Other Keys
The same principles apply to all 12 major keys.

## Circle of Fifths

## Relative Minor Keys
Each major key has a relative minor key containing exactly the same notes.

## Key Signatures

## Scales Shapes
Two important scale shapes are movable and can be transposed up the neck.

## Ukulele Movable Chord Shapes
Open and movable chords allow flexibility when playing different positions.
